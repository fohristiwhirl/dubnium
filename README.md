# 🐢 🐊 🦎 🐍

Basically-working alternate *engine* (not bot) for Halite 3.

It has been observed to produce 100% consistency with the official engine (using deterministic bots and the same starting map) on at least one occasion!

# Usage:

Dubnium has its own half-baked mapgen, but you can also load the map from a (decompressed, plain-JSON) replay:

`./dubnium.exe -f replay.json bot1.exe bot2.exe bot3.exe bot4.exe`
